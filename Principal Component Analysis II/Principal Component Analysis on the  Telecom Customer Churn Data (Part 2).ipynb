    "\n",
    "During the previous analyses, it was noted that there existed a significant degree of multicollinearity among the different features within the dataset, resulting in an impact on the accuracy of the models. To address this issue, my objective for this analysis is to utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate a set of features that account for at least 80% of the variability within the data. By doing so, I aim to create a new set of variables and reevaluate the previous models to assess if they yield more favorable outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "PCA, or Principal Component Analysis, is a powerful method used to extract significant variables, called components, from a large set of features in a dataset. Its objective is to capture as much information as possible by projecting the data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space. This not only reduces the number of variables but also facilitates more meaningful data visualization.  It is particularly valuable when dealing with three or higher-dimensional data and is typically performed on a symmetric correlation or covariance matrix with standardized data. (Avcontentteam, 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing PCA, correlated features are transformed using a linear combination to create a new set of uncorrelated features, or components. These components are ranked based on the amount of variability they explain in the dataset. The most important components, which contribute the most to the variability, can be retained for regression and classification modeling, effectively addressing the issue of multicollinearity (Brems, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformed components retain a significant amount of information from the original dataset while reducing the dimensionality. The expected outcome of this analysis is to significantly decrease the number of features in the dataset, thereby reducing multicollinearity and improving the overall efficiency and interpretability of the models.\n",

    "# B2:PCA ASSUMPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between all variables. This assumption arises from the use of Pearson correlation coefficients in PCA, which require a linear relationship. However, in practice, this assumption can be relaxed when dealing with categorical data. While linearity can be assessed using a matrix scatterplot, this approach can become overwhelming due to the large number of potential linear relationships, often exceeding 500. Therefore, it is advisable to randomly select a few representative relationships between variables and test them, rather than examining every possible combination. This approach helps strike a balance between assessing linearity and avoiding excessive computational burden."

    "# D5. SUMMARY OF DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the scaled data to identify the key sources of variance in the dataset. The Kaiser-Guttman criterion was used to determine the number of principal components to retain. The Kaiser-Guttman criterion states that only principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 should be retained, as these components explain more variance than any single original variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, the first 9 principal components were retained, explaining 61.7% of the total variance in the scaled data. The first principal component explained 14.0% of the variance, the second component explained 9.5%, and so on until the ninth component which explained 4.8%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the application of the Kaiser-Guttman criterion led to retaining 9 principal components, explaining 61.7% of the total variance in the data. The criterion provided a systematic and rigorous approach for determining the optimal number of components that capture the most meaningful variance in the dataset. The first 9 components identified represent the primary sources of variance and will be used for further analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next step is to build a PCA model which retains 80% of the variability in the data to satisfy the original aim of this analysis stated in Section D2."
