    "# B1. EXPLANATION OF PREDICTION METHOD\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering, or cluster analysis, is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to partition an unlabeled dataset or population into distinct groups. Its aim is to create clusters where data points within each group are more similar to each other and dissimilar to those in other groups, facilitating the organization of objects based on their similarities and differences (Priy, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA, is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that arranges clusters in a hierarchical order from top to bottom. Similar to organizing files and folders on a hard disk, this algorithm groups similar objects into clusters, resulting in a collection of distinct clusters where objects within each cluster share broad similarities (Chauhan, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our experiment, the objective is to apply hierarchical data clustering following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initially, each data point is treated as a single-point cluster, resulting in N clusters from N data points.\n",
    "2. The algorithm identifies the two closest data points and combines them to create a new cluster, reducing the number of clusters to N-1.\n",
    "3. The process continues by iteratively merging the two closest clusters at each step, further reducing the number of clusters to N-2.\n",
    "4. These merging steps are repeated until only one cluster remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment, we will apply hierarchical clustering to explore the structure and relationships among the data points. While hierarchical clustering itself does not determine specific outcomes, it can provide valuable insights that may contribute to understanding factors related to customer churn in network companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the resulting clusters, we can identify distinct customer groups with shared characteristics. These groups may offer insights into the underlying factors that contribute to customer churn. While the analysis does not directly determine the factors, it provides a framework for further investigation and exploration to uncover potential relationships and patterns that influence customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this hierarchical clustering analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of customer segmentation and identify potential indicators of customer churn in network companies.\n",

    "# B2. SUMMARY OF METHOD ASSUMPTION\n",
    "In Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), there is a fundamental assumption called \"monotonicity\" regarding the merge operation. This assumption states that when two clusters are combined, the distance between them will not be smaller than the distance between any previously merged clusters. In other words, as we continue merging clusters, the distances between the merged clusters will either remain the same or become larger.\n",

    "To produce visual representations of the data analysis by combining code and text reports, I will utilize Jupyter Notebook which will be executed using Python. I chose Python for the following reasons:  \n",

    "- Python is also equipped with various libraries that enhance its functionality, save time, and reduce code complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the libraries that are beneficial for this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas, which facilitates the manipulation and analysis of data in rows and columns.\n",
    "- Numpy, which enables the definition of arrays and complex matrices of all forms.\n",
    "- Filterwarnings, which helps to ignore warning messages and enhances readability.\n",
    "- Matplotlib, and Seaborn, which are used to create data visualizations.\n",
    "- Statsmodels and Scikit-learn, which enable the development of statistical and predictive models.\n",
    "- Sklearn: Python library for machine learning that offers various functionalities for creating statistical models. It provides several capabilities, including data splitting into training and test sets, offering machine learning model objects (in this case Hierarchical Clustering), tuning optimal model parameters, and analyzing the performance of the model.\n",

The model demonstrates a subpar level of accuracy, although it falls short of achieving nearly perfect clusters. While it can successfully cluster customers to some extent, it does not fully separate them into distinct groups that would yield highly valuable insights."

    "A notable limitation of this analysis was the selection of numerous features, leading to a time-consuming dendrogram generation. The presence of widely spread data possibly caused overlapping, resulting in less distinct and loosely bound clusters. To address this, a systematic reduction of selected features could be explored to improve cluster tightness and accuracy."

    "To provide stakeholders with valuable insights, I suggest conducting extensive and systematic analysis. This involves exploring different approaches to increase accuracy and achieve distinct customer segmentation. Several strategies can be pursued, including fine-tuning model parameters such as linkage and affinity, experimenting with data point reduction techniques, and even considering alternative clustering models like Divisive Clustering or K-Means Clustering. By implementing these actions, we aim to optimize the clustering process, leading to tighter clusters and improved insights for decision-making."
